30 Days of AI: Advanced Edition Challenge
Welcome to my repository for the #30DaysOfAI: Advanced Edition challenge! This is an intensive 30-day sprint to deepen my skills in Machine Learning and AI, moving from foundational concepts to advanced, real-world applications.
This repository documents my daily progress, including all the code, notebooks, and key insights I gather along the way.
What I'll Be Building
The challenge is broken down into four thematic weeks, each building upon the last:
Week 1: Foundations & First Predictions
I'll start by mastering advanced data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and storytelling with visualizations. I'll then build, tune, and evaluate several classic predictive models, including:
Logistic Regression for survival prediction.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
Decision Trees for explainable AI.
Linear Regression for price prediction.
Week 2: NLP and Computer Vision
This week, I'll dive into unstructured data. I'll build projects in:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Creating sentiment analyzers and spam detectors.
Computer Vision (CV): Using pre-trained models for image classification, face detection, and text extraction (OCR).
Unsupervised Learning: Finding dominant colors in images with K-Means.
Week 3: Deep Learning Deep Dive
Here, I'll focus on the architecture of intelligent systems. I'll be constructing and training:
Neural Networks from scratch and with Keras.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for complex image tasks.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-series forecasting.
Generative Models like Autoencoders and GANs.
Week 4: Production AI & Advanced Topics
The final week is about bringing AI into the real world. I'll be tackling:
Cutting-edge topics like Reinforcement Learning, Transformers (BERT), and Object Detection (YOLO).
MLOps: Deploying a model as a web API with Flask and Docker.
Crucial topics like Ethical AI, model monitoring, and building a modern RAG-powered chatbot.
A final Capstone Project to tie all these skills together.
Tech Stack
This challenge will primarily use the Python ecosystem for data science and AI:
Data Manipulation & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
Advanced AI: Hugging Face Transformers, OpenCV, LangChain
Deployment: Flask, Docker
Repository Structure
Each day's work, including Jupyter notebooks and code, is organized into its own folder (e.g., Day_01/, Day_02/).
